This project uses Python and data visualization libraries to analyze and visualize the distribution of population data by country and age group.

🧾 Task Objective
Create a bar chart or histogram to visualize the distribution of a categorical or continuous variable, such as the distribution of ages or genders in a population.

📁 Dataset
The dataset used is population_by_age_group.csv, which contains population figures for various countries across different age categories.

🛠️ Technologies Used
Python 🐍

Pandas 📊

NumPy 🔢

Matplotlib 📈

Seaborn 🎨

📈 Visualizations Included
Bar Chart of Total Population by Country
Shows the top 10 countries by total population.

Grouped Bar Chart by Age Group
Compares population distributions across age groups (0-4 years, 5-14 years, ..., 65+) for the top 10 most populous countries.
